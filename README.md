# Holomorphic functions and clustering
This program transforms one shape to another via a conformal mapping. It then measures the "distance" between two shapes by calculating the total stretching required to transform one shape into the other. Given a collection of shapes, it uses hierarchical clustering to group them based on these distances, placing similar shapes in clusters together.
